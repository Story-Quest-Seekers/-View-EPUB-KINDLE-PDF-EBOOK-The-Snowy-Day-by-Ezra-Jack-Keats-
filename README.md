The Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Let's make it political
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2019
Review: I loved this book as a small child in the 1980s, and it's still one of my favorites. I've bought this book for many baby showers and 1st birthdays--especially for white kids. To me, it's vital for white children to learn that joy, wonder, disappointment, and excitement are universal human emotions--they're experienced by people of all ethnic backgrounds.

To me, it's one little lesson that kids should learn young--that all people share similar feelings, that all people are equally human, that we all experience similar joys and disappointments, and that we're all very similar under the skin.

It's also a fun little story with a straightforward but important message about childhood--and life--and the artwork is astonishingly beautiful in its simplicity.

A classic for so many great reasons.

Review: I love this timeless classic book and its story of a boy's adventures on the first day of snow so it only made sense to buy the board book for my toddler to read to him during the snowy days here in Chicago! The story and artwork received the absolute most prestigious award for children's picture books, so my review cannot possibly do the justice it deserves. I am not even going to try to do that. I will say that the quality of the construction of the book is wonderful, it gets lots and lots of use from my toddler and is still in perfect condition. The author has several great books, my other favorite being Whistle for Willie, and the foundation created in his name does amazing work for children and reading.

Title: A Story to Melt Your Heart
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2020
Review: This is an easy review to write, as there is nothing I dislike about "The Snowy Day." Although it was published in 1962, it is still as fresh and new as, well, newly-fallen snow. Keats knew how to tell a story well, in both words and through his beautiful and colorful images. It is a perfect children's book, because it is written from their point of view, imbued with their unalloyed sense of wonder and enchantment. Most importantly, I think, is that Keats' main character, Peter, is a little African-American boy, who lives in an urban setting. Peter is neither caricatured nor is he a symbol of or vehicle for speaking about social issues, which would have been very easy to do at the time it was written. Instead, it is a timeless story about a young child discovering snow for the first time and trying to understand its mysterious nature. Although Peter does not fully comprehend snow, he enjoys experiencing it just the same. In simple and direct prose, Keats captures and conveys what it is like to be very young and to encounter the beauty and mystery of the natural world, even in an urban setting. I plan to read this book to the younger children in my church's Sunday school...but it's really for me.

Title: My Kiddo Loves It!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2017
Review: My toddler LOVES this little book. He's going on 3 next month and enjoys the Peter character also all the snow. Not long after it was delivered, I discovered that they made a cartoon version of the story that's on Amazon Prime video - just search "The Snowy Day". We found that and my son loves the story even more! I personally love the little 30 minute cartoon of the story too - very soulful.

FYI - not sure about the reviews mentioning a color issue. The book I received looks perfectly fine. (we have the board book version)

Review: This is a must for any little one. It's a classic, Caldecott winner about a little boy's fun in the snow. My one-year-old grandson was born and lives in Southern Arizona, and this may be his first exposure (albeit vicariously) to snow!!

Title: Terrible book.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2019
Review: I ordered 3 of these: one for my daughter, and one each for my neice and nephew. I wish I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure why this book has such great reviews. There is no plot to the book. It is a kid walking outside and coming home. No fancy writing. No rhymes. The pictures are terrible. Why this is considered ‚Äúa timeless book‚Äù In the reviews is beyond me. I gave it a three because it‚Äôs a sturdy book of good size for little hands and is not too long, but generally a terrible book.
